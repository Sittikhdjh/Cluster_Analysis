Species Segmentation with Cluster Analysis

The Iris flower dataset is one of the most popular ones for machine learning. We can read a lot about it online and have probably already heard of it: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iris_flower_data_set

There are 4 features; sepal length, sepal width, petal length, petal width.

Start by creating 2 clusters. Then standardize the data and try again. 

I used the Elbow rule to determine how many clusters are there.
